# Secure ML Model Deployment on Microsoft Azure

This covers some of the general aspects of a secure state of the art deployment and hence publishing of models on Micrsoft Azure. It covers in short the securing of a workspace, to one form of model deployment, and futhermore to another form of model publishing.  


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".
